Abstract:
8-tile is a very famous puzzle game and is used in study of Artificial
Intelligence. But here not implementing AI, we have implemented a
game where a player has to solve the game. This game has randomly
ordered tiles numbered from 1 to 8 and a empty slot in a 3x3 board.
Now a player has to rearrange the tile in either ascending order or
descending order and the empty slot has to be the last one in the
board. As we were studying this puzzle game in our curriculum, we
thought it would be a good idea to implement it by ourselves.

Project Flow:
Here, in this project, First we tried to implement this game in console,
that is, a non-gui command line based game, in which a random board
is generated initially to which user has to give an input to which tile to
slide. User would enter a tile number and if it is adjacent to the empty
slot, then it would slide to that empty slot, and if not, then nothing
would happen. Likewise, user has to give inputs to the game until the
winning criteria doesn’t match.
After successful implementation of non-gui based game, We built
a gui on top of it. Now user has to click on the tile which he wants to
slide. The tile switched places with the empty slot if both are adjacent
otherwise nothing happens.

Functions and Features of Python Used:
As we were completely new to Python and didn’t know anything about
it, the motive of doing this project was to learn basics of Python
programming. We had to learn the basics of Python first. As we were
completely new to Python, we have not used too many features or
functions or libraries available in Python. We have used basic
functions and features of Python like loops, function calling,
dictionaries, and lists. Also to build gui, We’ve used TKinter API of
Python. In which a frame is used to build the board, and buttons are
used to make tiles.

Conclusion:
By doing this project, we could learn and understand the basic
concepts of Python. Before this project, we did not have any prior
knowledge of Python. This project helped us in learning, implementing
and using the basic features and few of the advanced features such
as TKinter library of python programming language. We learnt the
basic features such as loops, control statements, function calling and
various in-built functions available in Python. Also, We learned OOP
concepts in python.
